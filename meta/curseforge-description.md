## <p style="text-align:center">Archogenum lets you embrace the role of a gene-engineer. Extract, combine, and rewrite the essence of living beings to synthesize unique xenofruits – mutable genetic blueprints that shape your survival, strength, and playstyle.</p>

<br>

# <p style="text-align:center">Important Notice</p>

**Archogenum is currently in beta – many features are incomplete or unstable**. This is my submission for **ModJam 2025**, which I joined late due to difficult personal circumstances as a refugee in Argentina. The mod is uploaded early to pass verification, and I don't recommend using it in survival yet until after the jam, as I'll be actively expanding and polishing its systems.

Archogenum is planned as part of a larger series of immersive, thematically connected mods alongside **Ars Elixirum** and others, focused on roles like **alchemist**, **gene-engineer**, and **enchanter**, all centered on exploration, experimentation, and self-expression.

<br>

# <p style="text-align:center">Features</p>

- 🧬 <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Genetic Engineering**</span> – Extract genes from creatures and weave them together to create specialized or extraordinary xenotypes.
- ♻️ <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Dynamic Xenotypes**</span> – Your xenotype isn't permanent. Swap, reforge, and experiment freely with different gene combinations during your journey.
- 🔥 <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Environmental Adaptation**</span> – Craft xenotypes built for specific environments. For example, become heat-resistant and immune to Wither effects to explore the Nether while running across lava like it's solid ground.
- ⚔️ <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Unique Traits & Synergies**</span> – Genes define your abilities, resistances, and weaknesses. Become undead and heal from poison, or transform into a hybrid predator with enhanced strength and speed.
- 🐾 <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Full Creature Xenotypes**</span> – Xenotypes aren't limited to yourself. You can combine traits from any living creature: produce eggs, give milk, drop pork... or even implant xenotype traits into other creatures to boost their productivity, survival, or special abilities. Yes, you can implant milking glands into a friend xD
- 🧪 <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Experimental Gameplay**</span> – Archogenum avoids grind-heavy mechanics and complicated multi-block setups. The focus is on exploration, experimentation, and creativity.
- 🧰 <span style="color:#CED4D9;">**Fully Data-Driven**</span> – Every gene, trait, and xenotype system is fully data-driven. You can edit existing genes or add entirely new ones without touching a single line of code.

This mod is actively expanding – with more xenotypes, gene interactions, and ancient Archogenes planned. Community feedback and custom gene packs are welcome!
